# Fractal Formula Generator üåÄ

The Fractal Formula Generator is a web application that allows users to generate and explore beautiful fractal patterns. Fractals are intricate and infinitely detailed mathematical shapes that exhibit self-similarity at different scales.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Fractal Generation:** Users can generate fractal patterns by customizing the fractal formula parameters.
- **Real-time Preview:** The application provides a real-time preview of the generated fractal as users adjust the formula parameters.
- **Interactive Controls:** Users can interact with the fractal by zooming in, panning, and exploring different regions of the pattern.
- **Formula Presets:** The application includes pre-defined formula presets for popular fractal types such as Mandelbrot and Julia sets.
- **Save and Share:** Users can save and share their favorite fractal images with others.

## Usage üöÄ

To use the Fractal Formula Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Application:** Open the following link in your web browser: [Fractal Formula Generator](https://utkarssh11.github.io/Fractal--Formula-Generator/)

2. **Adjust the Formula Parameters:** Use the provided controls and sliders to adjust the fractal formula parameters. You can modify variables such as iterations, scale, color, and more.

3. **Explore the Fractal:** Interact with the fractal by zooming in, panning, and exploring different regions of the pattern. Observe how the fractal evolves and reveals intricate details.

4. **Save and Share:** Once you're satisfied with a particular fractal pattern, use the application's save or share feature to capture and share the image with others.

## Technologies Used üíª

The Fractal Formula Generator is implemented using the following technologies:

- **HTML:** Markup language for structuring the web page.
- **CSS:** Stylesheet language for visual styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** Programming language for interactive functionality and fractal generation.
- **Canvas API:** HTML5 feature for rendering and manipulating graphical elements.
